title: Looking for a DDR3 1333Mhz Ripjaws 4GB module from Jun 2014
---

As my computer has already a few years it isn't compatible with some newer models of this same memory, I tested it myself, I got already a module fabricated on Jun 2014 that works fine but a few weeks back I bought one on a local store from Oct 2014 that didn't work on my computer and I had to return it.

You can check the production date on the module warranty sticker.

For this reason I am searching actively for a model of similar dates of Jun 2014, if you are a store and happen to have one model and willing to send to Spain please let me know. Thanks in advance!
