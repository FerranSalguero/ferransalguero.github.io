title: Recommended PC builds Summer 2015

Starting this summer I want to give some PC rig configurations from budget to gamer and, of course, an advanced user. Some components can be used to upgrade your existing computer, like an [SSD][7] or a new graphic card. I want to set 3 typical tiers, **budget** around $500, advanced $800 and top at $1200.

Budget
------

A good configuration for playing last year games or The Witcher 3 at low quality:

* CPU: [Intel Core i3-4150 $120][1]
* Motherboard: [ASRock H81M-HDS $50][2]
* Memory: [Corsair Vengeance 8 GB (2 x 4 GB) DDR3 1600 MHz $50][3]
* Graphics: [Asus Radeon R7 260X $127][4]
* CPU Cooler: Intel stock cpu cooler included in CPU package
* Hard drive: [Any WD with 7200rpm depending on your budget, from $40][5]
* Power supply: [Corsair Builder Series CX 600 $40][6]

**Total: $427**

Under the initial $500 budget, probably the difference can be used to get an SSD like the 2nd tier build.


Advanced
--------

A mid-tier PC, unlocked, The Witcher 3 at a decent quality:

* CPU: [Intel Core i5-4690K $230][8]
* Motherboard: [ASRock Z97 Anniversary $90][9]
* Memory: [Kingston HyperX Savage 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 1866MHz DDR3 CL9 $105][10]
* Graphics: [Sapphire Radeon R9 380 4GB $250][11]
* CPU Cooler: [Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO $35][12]
* Hard drive: [Samsung 850 EVO 250GB $100][13]
* Power supply: [Corsair Builder Series CX 600 $40][6]

**Total: $850**

A little over budget but worth the extra penny, paying a little more for the 4GB video card can extend the life of this build a few years more.


Top

A top-tier PC, unlocked, The Witcher 3 at a ultra quality:

* CPU: [Intel Core i7-4790K $325][14]
* Motherboard: [Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD3H-BK $135][15]
* Memory: [Kingston HyperX Savage 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 1866MHz DDR3 CL9 $105][10]
* Graphics: [Asus GTX 980 Ti 6GB $660][17]
* CPU Cooler: [Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO $35][12]
* Hard drive: [Samsung 850 Pro 256GB $140][18]
* Power supply: [Corsair Builder Series CX 600 $40][6]

**Total: $1440**

Also over budget but worth paying a few extra bucks for the best video card in the market.
