    <p>
       Hi there, I recently migrated my blog to a new platform and may have broken
       a lot of links inadvertently.
   </p>
   <p>
       If you don't mind, please
       <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/FerranSalguero/ferransalguero.github.io/issues/new">log an issue</a>
       with the URL you were trying to reach and where you found the URL. Thanks!
   </p>
